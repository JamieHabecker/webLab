				alteration of a motor vehicleâ€™s odometer with the intent 
				to change the number of miles indicated.

				Use this form to request that DMV LE investigate instances 
				or suspected instances of motor vehicle odometer fraud, whether (1) you

				an individual, business, or organization that knowingly engages in odometer fraud. 
				Submitting the form will trigger an email to DMV LE at [enforcement@dmv.virginia.gov](mailTo://enforcement@dmv.virginia.gov).

				All complaints are reviewed by DMV law enforcement.  Some complaints are complex and may 
				require several weeks or months to resolve.

				Falsely reporting a crime is illegal and punishable as a misdemeanor (VA Code &18.2-461).
